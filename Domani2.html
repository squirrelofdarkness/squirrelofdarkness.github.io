    <h1>On Wednesday</h1>
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>On Wednesday, I only had classes in the art department. I learned how to use a panel saw
        and a compound miter saw and did brainstorming excercises. </p>
    <h3>The Drive</h3>
    <p>After all our classes were over, my partner and I drove all the way to my house in Niceville
        to retrieve their backpack. I did not like how other people on I-10 were driving, but we got
        to and from my house safely. It was nice to see my mom again, especially since that happened
        to be her birthday.</p>
    <h3>The Incident</h3>
    <p>After dropping my partner back off at her dorm, I parked in back of mine. However, I accidentally
        pulled up too far and felt myself bump the wheelstop. I put my car in reverse to correct my parking
        but when I tapped on the gas, she didn't move. I had to call my insurance company to get a tow truck
        to pull my car off a piece of rebar that was sticking out of the wheelstop and had hooked itself on
        her undercarriage. It was a very long night.</p>
