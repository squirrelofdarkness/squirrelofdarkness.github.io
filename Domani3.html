    <h1>The Aftermath</h1>
    <p>The next day, I went in for an appointment to get my starter replaced. On my way home from the
        mechanic, a sportscar floored it to get in front of my and kicked up a rock that put a seven-inch 
        crack in my windshield. I am very glad I got back to campus safely and am holding onto the saying that
        such things only happen in threes.</p>
