    <h1>Prequel to Wednesday</h1>
    <h3>THIS IS A CHANGE</h3>
    <p>The previous day, my mother had come out to Pensacola
        to bring me some things I needed, and she helped my partner
        and I get to the discount bookstore to buy our textbooks.
        We had decided to go out for coffee afterwards, and my partner
        forgot her backpack in my mother's car. Neither of us realized
        this until after she had driven away, and because her phone was
        on silent, there was no way for us to tell her until after she had
        already driven the whole way home.
